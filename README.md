After choosing the year whether it is 2017 or 2018, the client will be presented with the amount of time it took the code to run.

## Summary

**What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?** 

One advantage of refactoring is that it is a great way to maintain the code. A second advantage is that it keeps the code clean and organized for others to follow. Refactoring also has some disadvantages. One disadvantage is that refactoring takes time due to the need to expand into multiple data analysis. A second disadvantage is the risk of existing code not having proper test cases.

**How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**

The pros and cons apply to refactoring the VBA script in that its time consuming and if you have a deadline to meet you have to see if you will be able to get it done by the deadline. For this project, the length of time to refactor increased compared to writing the original code. When comparing the codes, it is easier to follow the second code because more comments were added to explain the purpose of the code.
